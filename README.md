# Doom's Eye [WIP]
Guide and glossary for Shadow Generations speedrunning. Currently unfinished. Feel free to contribute by either making a pull request or messaging me @sleepiesther on discord

## Getting Started

### Setup
To start off, you'll need some way to record your run. 

On console you can use a capture card connected to a PC, use the console's built in recording system (unfortunately not an option on Switch, as the 30 second recording limit is too short for basically any run), or record your monitor with a camera or a phone (make sure your video is a good enough quality to be verified!). 

On PC you can use basically any recording software, the most popular being [OBS](https://obsproject.com). [Click here for a good setup guide for OBS made by Stelmo.](https://youtu.be/qQOZOx5U6Qs?t=201&si=pVGXzBe3xppYrp9_) It's made for Project 06 but the steps for Shadow Generations are basically the same.

If you're running a [category](#categories) timed using IGT or RTA, you're all set! If you're running a category timed using LRT, you'll need to setup [LiveSplit](https://livesplit.org) and include the loadless timer in your recording. You can learn how to set up the loadless timer [here](https://www.speedrun.com/Shadow_Generations/guides/btoqj).

### Settings and binds

### FPS optimisation

## Categories
Shadow Generations speedruns are separated into multiple different categories, each with a different ruleset. 
There are three different timing methods used for Shadow Generations:
- In Game Time (IGT). IGT is the time you see when you complete a level. This timer is paused by Chaos Control.
  
- Real Time Attack (RTA). RTA is very simple, you start a timer at the start of the run, and end it when you finish the run.
  
- Load Removed Time (LRT). LRT is a PC exclusive timing method. It is a modified RTA that pauses during load screens, so that differing specs does not affect runs.

### Individual Level (IL)
IL runs are speedruns of a single level in the game, such as a main stage, boss, or challenge. ILs are timed using IGT, so using Chaos Control to pause the timer is integral to getting a good time, which leads to unique routing compared to other categories.

### Any%
Any% runs start from a new game and aim to reach the credits as quickly as possible. Time starts when you select the save file for your new game, and ends when you finish the button mash at the end of Neo Devil Doom. PC runs are timed using LRT, and console runs are timed using RTA.

### All Stages
All Stages runs complete every main stage and boss in the game. There are two All Stages categories: one that allows the use of Doom Wings and one that doesn't. You can complete the stages in any order, but Devil Doom must be last. Time starts when you press the input to enter the first stage, and ends when you finish the button mash at the end of Neo Devil Doom. PC runs are timed using LRT, and console runs are timed using RTA.

### All Challenges
All Challenges runs complete every challenge in the game. The use of Wings is allowed, but they're rarely actually used. You can complete the challenges in any order. Time starts when you input to enter the first challenge, and ends when you press continue after completing the final challenge. PC runs are timed using LRT, and console runs are timed using RTA.

### 100%
100% runs aim to get both percentages in the Records tab of the menu to 100% from a new file. Timing is the same as Any%.
