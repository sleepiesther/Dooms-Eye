# Doom's Eye [WIP]
Guide and glossary for Shadow Generations speedrunning. Currently unfinished. Feel free to contribute by either making a pull request or messaging me @sleepiesther on discord

## Getting Started

### Setup
To start off, you'll need some way to record your run. 

On console you can use a capture card connected to a PC, use the console's built in recording system (unfortunately not an option on Switch, as the 30 second recording limit is too short for basically any run), or record your monitor with a camera or a phone (make sure your video is a good enough quality to be verified!). 

On PC you can use basically any recording software, the most popular being [OBS](https://obsproject.com). [Click here for a good setup guide for OBS made by Stelmo.](https://youtu.be/qQOZOx5U6Qs?t=201&si=pVGXzBe3xppYrp9_) It's made for Project 06 but the steps for Shadow Generations are basically the same.

If you're running a [category](#categories) timed using IGT or RTA, you're all set! If you're running a category timed using LRT, you'll need to setup [LiveSplit](https://livesplit.org) and include the loadless timer in your recording. You can learn how to set up the loadless timer [here](https://www.speedrun.com/Shadow_Generations/guides/btoqj).
