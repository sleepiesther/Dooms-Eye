Guide and glossary for Shadow Generations speedrunning. Currently unfinished. Feel free to contribute by either making a pull request or messaging me @sleepiesther on discord

## Getting Started

### Setup
To start off, you'll need some way to record your run. 

On console you can use a capture card connected to a PC, use the console's built in recording system (unfortunately not an option on Switch, as the 30 second recording limit is too short for basically any run), or record your monitor with a camera or a phone (make sure your video is a good enough quality to be verified!). 

On PC you can use basically any recording software, the most popular being [OBS](https://obsproject.com).

If you're running a category timed using IGT or RTA, you're all set! If you're running a category timed using LRT, you'll need to setup [LiveSplit](https://livesplit.org) and include the loadless timer in your recording.
