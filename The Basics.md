# The Basics

## Chaos Control

Chaos Control is charged by killing enemies, or by breaking a Chaos Control Capsule. 5 normal enemies (egg pawns, GUN robots etc) or a single Black Arms enemy will fully charge your Chaos Control.

When Chaos Control is activated you gain a few benefits:

- The In Game Timer stops for 6 seconds (yes I know the counter starts at 5 but trust me it is 6)
- Most nearby objects or enemies freeze in place, and are unaffected by damage until time is restored. You are also able to stand on some otherwise damaging objects, such as missiles.
- Your boost gauge is immediately filled to 100%

The IGT pause is essential in [IL runs](<Getting Started.md#individual-level-il>), that are timed using IGT. IT is often worth it to take a "slower" route in ILs that gets more Chaos Controls.
