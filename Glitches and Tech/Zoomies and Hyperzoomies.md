## Zoomies

- FPS: All
- Patch: All

Jumping into a damage hazard and spearing at the same time you get damaged, while holding forward inside a tube with autorun physics, gives you a huge burst of speed. The timing for the spear is much more forgiving at lower framerates, but the amount of speed gained is higher at higher framerates.

So far, the only known use for this is in Sunset Heights Act 1, but in theory, it should work in other tubes if there's a consistent way to take damage.

## Hyperzoomies

- FPS: 75 (Vsync), 120
- Patch: All

Touching the dash pads on the right side at the second-to-last tube in Sunset Heights Act 1 while carrying the burst of speed from Zoomies will launch you incredibly high while still maintaining tube physics. Having tube physics makes this trick really difficult to control â€” you basically need to hit a perfect angle for the air boost after the launch. Since tube physics automatically move you forward, you can't aim your air boost like usual.

You want to use the air boost early enough to pass the trigger that removes your tube physics at the end, allowing you to reach the goal ring. The launch gives you less height at 75 FPS, which is achievable by using a 75 Hz monitor with Vsync on, or by changing your GPU settings. The lower height makes 75 FPS optimal for this trick.

Runners have been able to hit it in IL runs, but no consistent method has been found for pulling it off at 120 FPS so far.
