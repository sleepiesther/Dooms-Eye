# Mohawk Tuah

The first step of this trick is to activate the automation of the dash pads leading to the tube in Space Colony ARK Act 1.
This can be done simply by touching them. For some reason, the automation physics will never be disabled, so you'll want to jump back in order to run into them with automation already activated.

The jump back can be quite tricky at times. A good method is to homing attack two of the floating rocks, then hold left to turn Shadow around. After that, air boost using two spears, followed by two more spears after a double jump. Then stop using the spears to land safely on the platform without overshooting.

Position yourself on the dark line in the center of the platform. The exact position is up to preference, see what works for you. Face directly right, then neutral boost and spear.

After getting launched, spam spear until you see Shadow throw 2 spears. Once he does, hold double jump and curve to the right, when Radical Highway loads in, align yourself with this building and go straight forward.

Once that building disappears, start spearing while still holding jump. Spam spear 11 - 13 times (the exact amount will depend on how quickly you press spear), then stop spearing. Once Shadow suddenly loses a lot of speed, start spearing again to fast fall. You should be able to land on the ending slide and beat the level.
