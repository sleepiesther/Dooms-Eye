# Tube Glitch

Tube Glitch is a physics exploit where you retain the autorun mechanics of a tube without actually being inside one. This results in anti-gravity-like jump height, which varies depending on your framerate. While in this state, you're also forced to move in the direction the tube was originally facing.

The only known application of this glitch is in Space Colony Ark Act 1. The very first tube in the stage has a trigger for tube physics that extends beyond the entrance. This allows you to activate tube physics without entering the tube itself. (Thank you to fivavoa for this image!

The most consistent setup involves positioning yourself in front of the small cubes on either side of the tube and air boosting forward.

Once youâ€™ve triggered the glitch, the route you take may vary depending on your framerate, due to the differing jump heights. These route changes tend to be minimal, every significant application of this glitch is possible on all frame rates. 

To get rid of these physics, you can either die, enter another tube, or enter a cutscene.
