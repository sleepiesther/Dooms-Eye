In Space Colony ARK 1, there are gravity panels that let you run on them depending on their orientation. If you jump off a side and stomp at the right time, your stomp will follow the direction the gravity panels would normally hold you in. If the gravity panel is oriented like a wallrun, it can carry you great distances.
