Have 50 rings and a Chaos Control charge before the large loop at the start of ARK 2. 

Activate Wings and Wing tech up to the platform with the spring. Allow your boost to regenerate, then take the spring and Chaos Snap the enemy. At the peak of the recovery animation, double jump, Wing tech 4 times left and right, then keep Wing teching to the right and into the loop. You should land on the top of the loop and be able to walk on it.

Double jump and orient yourself to generally face the area of the level just before you go inside the ARK. Start flying, use sidesteps to increase your distance. Once you have about 4 boosts left in your gauge, start Wing teching and use a Chaos Control to continue Wing teching. You should have just enough height to land back in the level. You can Wing tech up onto the rail and continue as normal.
