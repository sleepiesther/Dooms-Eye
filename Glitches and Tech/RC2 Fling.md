# RC2 Fling
- Framerate: 120
- Patch: All

Do you like playing RC2? Me neither, this trick is used to basically skip the entire second half of the stage.

About half way through the stage you will encounter a cave with an automated sequence, you can use the caves automation to get launched into the air and fly across the stage all the way to the goal ring. 

Always make sure to stop spearing at the right time to cut your speed, otherwise you will overshoot past the goal ring.

Once you have lost all of your speed, you can start spearing again to fall faster than you would normally. 
Your stomp is locked once you use this fling, so this is your only method of height control.

There are three main methods for this fling:

## Low Method

Do a coyote jump when Shadow is roughly at the same height with the bolt on the girder, and then wait until Shadow is about to enter the cave to do an air boost and spear. 
There is a notch in the cave wall that when roughly in the centre of the screen is a good indicator for when to do the air boost. 

**It's important to note that in order to maintain your altitude you must do the spear immediately or near immediately after inputting boost.**

Delaying the spear any significant amount will cause Shadow to get flung up which can cause this setup variation to be finnicky and not work properly. 

Once you have done the air boost, Shadow will be either descending slightly or maintaining a constant altitude. 

Once he is in line with a red girder further in the cave, double jump, wait slightly, to gain speed, and then start spearing. 

You will be flung towards the end of the level, and for the most consistent results, stop spearing to kill your speed once Shadow is just above the 3 rails at the end of the level. It is possible to stop spearing later to be closer to the goal but this is ill advised for consistent results as it's easy to overshoot.

## High Method

Use a Coyote Jump and air boost with a slightly delayed spear when Shadow is behind the cave entrance in the foreground. If done correctly, the air boost will carry you upwards above the cave. 

Make sure to not go too high or you will fly upwards without any control to do anything. 

After being above the cave, wait a bit and keep spearing before you double jump. Make sure you delay the spears after the double jump, you want to carry the upwards speed you get from the launch of the double jump with the spears. 

Since you will most likely have a different height above the cave for each attempt, the height you get after the launch also varies, so the exact time save will differ.

## Automation Pull Method

This method follows the same principle as the high method, but uses the automation pull for a more desirable height above the cave to get launched with less height. 

After the air boost, spear 4 times and stop spearing while being above the cave. 

After a second you will notice Shadow will be pulled straight downwards really quick, you want to catch the start of the pull for the double jump timing. 

This method will also vary in results but generally your launch will be lower than the others.
