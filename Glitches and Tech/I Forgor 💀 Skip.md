To perform this trick, make sure you have a Chaos Control charge and 50 rings after you take the ramp after the first checkpoint in Chaos Island 2.

Then, pop Wings and literally just fly backwards. Keep going backwards until you get to this ledge.

Ground boost under the ledge, double jump, then Wing tech once and keep spearing until you get free cam. Once you do, wait a short amount of time and start flying in the direction of the big spiky rock thing. If you start flying too early you'll hit a death plane. Use your Chaos Control to extend your flight.

Aim to re-enter by landing on the bouncy pole thing (??? do those have names). You can Wing tech for additional height if needed.
