# Super Mario (Gravity Stomp Launch)
- FPS: All
- Patch: All
- Page Author: Moha

## Steps
- Position yourself preferably near the end of the platform, before the angled platform at the beginning of Radical Highway Act 1.
- Simply do a ground boost spear jump by pressing the spear, jump, and boost inputs at the same time while holding upright on your movement stick.
- Spearglide until you are close to reaching the gravity change, and do a double jump input right before the gravity change to get sent forward a little bit.
- Now stomp and wait until the gravity switches again. As soon as you notice Shadow turning from the gravity change, do an air boost while holding upright on your movement stick.
- Keep spearing to get enough distance. Stop spearing for a short time if you notice you're off course toward the building, and start spearing again after repositioning.
- The Wings cutscene can be skipped with this, but it still saves time if you land at the bottom of the building.
