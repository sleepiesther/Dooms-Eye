There’s a brief window after the automated wall-run in the Radical Highway section of Rail Canyon Act 1 where you can jump and escape the dive. 

It’s a very tight timing and becomes significantly harder with even the slightest frame drop. Your best bet is to mash jump as fast as possible. Works perfectly in tandem with [ERP](<https://github.com/sleepiesther/Dooms-Eye/blob/main/Glitches%20and%20Tech%2FESP%20and%20ERP.md#ERP>).
