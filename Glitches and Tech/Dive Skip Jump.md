There’s a brief window after the automated wall-run in the Radical Highway section of Rail Canyon Act 1 where you can jump and escape the dive. 

It’s a very tight timing and becomes significantly harder with even the slightest frame drop. Your best bet is to mash jump as fast as possible. Works perfectly in tandem with [ERP](<Glitches and Tech/ESP and ERP.md#ERP>).
