You'll need 50 rings and a Chaos Control charge just after the first turn in Sunset Heights 2. To do this trick you'll need to get out of bounds by ground boost jumping off of the nearby slope, then Wing tech out of bounds.

Once you get out of bounds, ground boost and jump off of the ledge, hold the jump for a while, and double jump to let your boost refill, then start flying until you pass above the turn. Once you do, start spearing and fall.

You have two options here:
- Fly to the sewers section, which is much easier but saves less time
- Fling off of the upcoming rail, which is much harder (and also 120 FPS exclusive) but saves more time.

To fly to the sewers section, simply fly up right when you get 3D control. You might bonk on an invisible wall if you don't fall for long enough though, so make sure to wait a short time before flying. Sidestep right for extra distance, and use Chaos Control to extend your flight. When you see the level pop back in, find a good spot to re-enter.

To fling, fall until Shadow is below the gray stone wall. Fly along the 2D plane to the rails, use a Chaos Control for more boost when needed. Position yourself as far right as possible while still being able to see the level. Use the tubes ahead of you to ensure you have the right height, you want to be just inline with these lines.

Once the tubes hit the left edge of your camera, stop flying and spear two or three times. You should get pulled up left by the automation. Start holding up right. Once Shadow has moved up right a bit from your input, fly back into the rail. This should fling you pretty fast.

Redirect the speed to the goal by Wing teching. The goal is almost exactly to the right of the direction you originally came from. You can use the rail and the part of the level you can see to align.

Wing tech to the goal, and re-enter when you can see it. You might get caught ontop of an invisible ceiling when you re-enter. That's ok, you can (somewhat slowly) slide down it to hit the goal ring)
