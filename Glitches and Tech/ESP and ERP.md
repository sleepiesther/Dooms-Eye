## ERP

Jump and air-boost into the dash pads during the automated wall-run section in the Radical Highway portion of Rail Canyon Act 1 to gain a massive speed boost, while still hitting the red ring at the top. 

The further the dash pads are from the middle, the higher the speed you get. Be careful not to air-boost into the outermost dash pads, as this will trigger ESP.
