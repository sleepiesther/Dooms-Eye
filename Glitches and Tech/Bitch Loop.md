Bitch loop refers to the automated loop in White Space that connects Kingdom Valley and Sunset Heights. We can break it in order to achieve a very high launch.

To do this, you need to position yourself at the upper-left corner of the golden square section inside the loop, then neutral stick stomp into the dashpads below.

This trick can be really finicky and a major pain in the butt, because sometimes it just refuses to work â€” even if you feel like you're doing the exact same thing as before. (RIP many any% runs o7.)

There are two main methods runners use to get a launch:

Method 1:
Simply walk into the corner, let go of your stick, and stomp into the dashpads.

Method 2:
Double jump into the corner, hold forward to press yourself into the loop, and then neutral stick stomp when you're positioned correct
