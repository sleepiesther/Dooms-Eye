There is an automated wind rail in the ending section of Kingdom Valley Act 2 that normally needs to be activated in order to progress. However, it is possible to enter that automation without actually activating the wind rail.

Start by sliding under the wind rail activation lever and preparing a coyote jump with it (make sure not to boost under the lever, as this will make your hitbox larger and activate the lever). Time the coyote jump so that you pass below the torch in the background. Hold the jump until the camera has turned to the other side, then air boost using exactly three spears. After the third spear, wait slightly, then double jump to get launched into the air and pass above an invisible wall.

Even if you don't make it over the invisible wall, getting high enough to trigger free cam allows you to move freely in 3D space and go around it instead of over itâ€”just make sure to land on the platform.

Now, keep the control stick neutral and hold jump when leaving the platform to get launched high again. Be careful not to go too high; you can cut your height increase with a double jump and an air boost toward the goal ring.
