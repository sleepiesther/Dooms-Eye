## Steps
- Have Wings activated and a Chaos Control charge before the spring that takes you into the background in Kingdom Valley Act 2.
- Take the spring, double jump as soon as you can, wing tech twice to the left and hold left to walk up the pillar.
- Walk back onto the pillar wall, turn to face upwards, and boost jump upwards.
- At the apex of your jump, double jump and fly to the right.
- Land on the second wall you see.

- **On 120 FPS**, jump a slight bit forward and stomp. You now have very big uppies.
- Face parallel to the castle path to your left, and wing tech once.
- Keep spearing until you see Shadow start to fall. Note the IGT.
- Once about 3 to 4 seconds have passed since Shadow started falling, start flying. The timing isn't too tight
- Use a Chaos Control to extend your flight.
- Once you have about 35%-45% left in your second boost gauge, stop flying and start spearing.
- You'll see the level pop back in, navigate to the goal ring and complete the level.
