# Rail Canyon 1 Cutscene Skip
- FPS: All
- Patch: All
- Author: Esther

## Steps
- Have Wings activated and more than 50 rings as you approach the entrance to the Radical Highway section of Rail Canyon 1
- Fly to the end of the rail that the cutscene normally happens on, just ahead of the boost pad.
- You should hit a Wings removal trigger, see the door to the Radical Highway section open, but **not** lose control of Shadow.
- Reactivate Wings, this is why you need to keep an eye on your ring count.
- Keep grinding along the rail and jump just as you reach the now opened door. This avoids another movement lock trigger. You might hit another Wings removal trigger, if you do just reactivate Wings again.
- At the end of the rail, boost and neutral jump, then neutral double jump.

You have two options now: 
- Wingtech forward to skip the cutscene and save a few seconds.
- Wingtech to the left to skip the cutscene **AND** avoid losing the ability to Chaos Control.

Going forward is pretty self explanatory, just make sure that you have enough height to land on the platform with the checkpoint.

Going left is a bit harder, as you have to deal with some invisible walls that block your path. Chaos Snap to the beetles or Wings sidestep through the invisible walls to get back in bounds. Avoiding the Chaos Control trigger also inherently means avoiding the checkpoint, so it's a little risky in a no-reset.
