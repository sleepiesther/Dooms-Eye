# Teleport Fling
- FPS: 120, 60

In order to set it up, go to the very first loop in Radical Highway 2.
Try to wallrun on the left street barrier—make sure you’re high enough so the loop physics on top of the street don’t trigger.
You can also hit the spring from there, so ideally try to wallrun from above the spring.

Now, boost downward to trigger the automation of the loop. If done correctly, Shadow will get stuck standing still on the wall for about 10 seconds before waking up and running.
Jump off the wall to go through the loop. You'll now pass through it with your full moveset available.

On 120fps, you can simply jump out after touching the first set of dash pads in the loop.
On 60fps, mash the jump button just before hitting the dash pads to make it out.

Its important to not touch the last dashpads as they will remove the loop physics.

Now, there’s a floating building you can wallrun on to get on top of the rooftop where you want to do the fling.

This part technically works on 120fps, but you gain so much height and speed that it becomes really difficult to manage—so for now, use the 60fps version.

Position yourself on the right side, in the middle of the 3rd tile of the rooftop. (The jump can be done from anywhere, but this just seemed like the easiest spot for me.)

Do a holding jump up-right and keep holding until you feel stuck against an invisible wall. Then, do a double jump to get launched.
Immediately do a boost spear with a back-left angle and recenter your camera. After that, perform three spears total (including the first boost spear), followed by a boost spear angled up-right, and then two more spears. Stop spearing right after.

You should still retain a good amount of speed after the speed drop-off. Locate the ending and manage your boost to reach it.
There are some invis walls around the ending you can sidestep through while flying.
