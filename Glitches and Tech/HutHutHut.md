At the very start of the Biolizard fight, perform a max-height double jump, then use an air boost followed by a spear into the corner to the right of the Biolizard's face. There’s an invisible wall there that usually slides you off, as you're not meant to stand on it. However, if you're in spear state, you can walk on it normally.

You need to do this before the Biolizard starts attacking, so your time is limited, but you do have enough time to collect some rings for safety. Inside the invisible wall, there's a pit you can drop into that will teleport you upwards. Keep using spear as quickly as possible to avoid losing spear state when you're teleported.

Once you're up, walk along the Biolizard’s back. Keep using spear to avoid sliding off, and wait for phase 1’s attack cycle to finish. When it's over, you can directly homing attack the back.
