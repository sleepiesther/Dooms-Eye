## Setup
Do you like playing RH1? I do, but sadly, it’s faster not to play it :(((

With the RH1 fling, you can fly across the entire level and reach the end within seconds.

The first part is to reach the loop after the Black Arms enemy that throws shields at you.

We want to break out of the loop. This is as easy as it looks — just dodge the dash pads and hold a neutral stick jump to jump out of it. Make sure you have a good amount of speed before entering the loop. 

After you break out, you want to jump on top of the building on the right side behind you. We go there so we can drop ourselves down into the loop again and get flung at incredibly high speeds. 

Slowly walk off the building and start spearing as soon as you notice Shadow being swung by the automation.

From here, there are multiple ways to land safely somewhere:

## Building fling:
- FPS: 120, 60

After being flung by the loop, do a double jump and let it play out a little bit while re-angling yourself forward. Start spearing again after you’ve re-angled yourself. Keep spearing until you reach the building wallrun. 

Now simply boost and spear towards the building. Make sure you press spear and boost at the same time to avoid losing all your speed.

If you’re running wingless, it’s a very forgiving up-right angle since an invisible wall will block you from going too far to the right.

If you’re running with Wings, you’ll lose your Wings mid-air due to flying through the Wings removal trigger from the sliding section. This gives you the ability to stop all your momentum immediately by popping Wings. 

Simply do the same airboost as wingless but pop Wings right before the wallrun and fly into it. Make sure to press sidestep while flying into the building in case you need to breach invisible walls.

This is the easiest and safest iteration of the trick, though it’s the slowest, while still skipping a huge chunk of the stage.

## Skibeetle Fling
- FPS: 120

With this version, you want to hit a very specific angle with the fling. 

Hold left with a slight upward angle and do a jump spear cancel when Shadow is right in the middle of the red and green-marked buildings.

You know your angle is good when Shadow is right above the red-marked building as the level unloads.

When everything loads back in, you want to use your airboost when Shadow is very slightly above the skewed building. 

If you are too high, you’ll hit a kill plane and die; if you are too low, you’ll hit a gravity flip and lose all your speed.

If done correctly, you can mash the homing attack button and snap onto the Egg Beetles on your way. 

This is technically possible at 60 FPS, but no setup has been found yet.

## God Fling
- FPS: 120

This version skips straight to the end of the level. 

After being flung, hold a neutral stick and do a double jump spear cancel when the first building you see on the left is halfway past your screen.

For the next part, it’s important to use your airboost at the correct height. Use the white building as a visual reference to gauge your height and know when to airboost. 

You want to be around this height (between both red lines) and airboost towards the ending corkscrew.

![God Fling Good Height Cue](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/132e5bcd-d2fe-4b14-afd6-369c1477cf20)

Keep flying a bit before you pop your Wings to come to a halt, and simply fly to the ending corkscrew. Make sure to sidestep while flying in case you need to breach invisible walls in your way. 

Since you can pop Wings and correct any angle errors from the airboost, any angle can make it to the end as long as your height is correct and your direction is towards the corkscrew. 

This is technically possible at 60 FPS, but no setup has been found yet.

## Wingless God Fling
- FPS: 120

As the name suggests, this is just Godfling, but without Wings. 

Since you have no Wings, you cannot save your boost angle — after you use your airboost, you either make it or you
don't.

This means your airboost angle and height need to be perfect so you fly directly into the
ground of the corkscrew. 

This is a very difficult trick and has only been used in individual level runs.

## Omega Fling
- FPS: 120

Yes, there’s an even worse version. 

With Omega Fling, you essentially want to perform a wingless Godfling — but without touching the corkscrew itself. 

You either want to fly into the corkscrew’s automation from a side angle, or fly into it from below the bridge and let
the automation carry you all the way to the rainbow rings at the end. 

After you airboost and hit the automation, pray it doesn't kick you out and kill you.
